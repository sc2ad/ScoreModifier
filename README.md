# ScoreModifier
A Beat Saber Mod that allows for different calculations of score.

This mod was made as an attempt to make the scoring for Beat Saber much more customizable.
It also does this by allowing for a new custom score as opposed to overwritting the old one.
This means, however, that the new score does not currently show in game.

This mod requires [BS_Utils](https://github.com/sc2ad/Beat-Saber-Utils) in order to function, so please make sure that is installed as well. You can find the binaries for both `BS_Util` and `ScoreModifier` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/sc2ad/ScoreModifier/releases)
